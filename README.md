# **Hello there, I'm** [Rabia Fatima](https://twitter.com/rabiaf183) 

I am a Blockchain Reserach Engineer learning about the scalability solutions for blockchain. I have done my most research around zero-knowledge based rollups and zkEVms. I have implemented proof systems like [PLONK](https://github.com/dusk-network/plonk) and [HALO2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2).
My purpose is to help community achieving the scalability we desire for a global supercomputer.

- 💻 I do reserach in Cryptography(ZK),Ethereum, L2 scaling solutions and abstract protocol concepts.
- ✍️  I write about Blockchain Infrastructure and Interoperability.
